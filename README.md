# Design system icons

A collection of icon og logo vector images for use in SDFI branded applications.

This repository is meant to be used in tandem with [Design System CSS](https://github.com/SDFIdk/design-system-css) repo at https://github.com/SDFIdk/design-system-css

Check out the example implementations in [example.html](example.html). 

## Usage

1. Fetch icon and logo files using NPM
   ```
   npm install https://github.com/SDFIdk/design-system-icons.git
   ```
2. Copy/import files to your main project any way you want.
   There is a handy bash script [utils/copy_assets.sh](./utils/copy_assets.sh) that copies all the SVGs into an `assets` directory in your project.
